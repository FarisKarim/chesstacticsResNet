# Residual Networks for Multi-Label Chess Tactic Classification

This project trains a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) to classify overlapping tactical motifs in chess puzzles (forks, pins, discovered attacks, etc.). A standard CNN baseline is also included for comparison.

ðŸ“Š Trained on 800,000 labeled puzzles from the [Lichess Puzzle Database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles).
